## Currently

On my current job, I work with a team of Java developers, sysadmins, and analysts in charge of one of the main Middleware implementations for Telefonica. Currently, I am part of SIBCO Consultants, working along with Practia. 

I work very close with IBM and AMDOCS teams. 
I am in charge of the servers every night from 8PM to 6AM, which means I am more than experienced in securing changes to the domains (our team also creates manuals for IBM to deploy and IBM consults us in case of any incident) and working fast in case there is any problem that disrupts the service at any given time.

### Research interests
For the sake of fun and learning, I am currently developing a Python program using Machine Learning and data-mining techniques that is able to recognize whether some text has a political stance.
This script uses the bag-of words approach for language processing, using the Naive-Bayes classifier (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier). 
The purpose is to learn Python libraries such as sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, and numpy


__###Capture the flag__

Since I was very young I did many of Capture the Flag (hacking) wargames. Currently, I am playing __hackthebox.eu__ and __ringzero__. These include many explotation techniques; as well as coding challenges, cryptography, binary explotation on Windows and Linux. I am very interested in these kind of games, they also capture the essence of many of my skills. I have some writeups on my site, but I am adding more and more every other day. Thanks to these challenges I am able to have a broad understanding of the security focus on the IT industry.
